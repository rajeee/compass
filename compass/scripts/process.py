    """Extract ordinances for one or more jurisdiction(s)

    This function scrapes ordinance documents (PDFs or HTML text) for a
    given set of jurisdictions and processes them using one or more
    LLM models. Output files, logs, and intermediate artifacts are
    stored in configurable directories.

    The processing has a well-defined order:

        1. Process any/all known local documents
        2. Process any/all known document URLs
        3. Search engine-based search for ordinance documents
        4. Jurisdiction website crawl-based search for ordinance
           documents

    Users can disable any of these steps via inputs to this function. If
    any step returns a document with extractable ordinance information,
    subsequent steps are skipped for that jurisdiction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out_dir : path-like
        Path to the output directory. If it does not exist, it will be
        created. This directory will contain the structured ordinance
        CSV file, all downloaded ordinance documents (PDFs and HTML),
        usage metadata, and default subdirectories for logs and
        intermediate outputs (unless otherwise specified).
    tech : str
        Label indicating which technology type is being processed. Must
        be one of the keys of
        :obj:`~compass.plugin.registry.PLUGIN_REGISTRY`.
    jurisdiction_fp : path-like
        Path to a CSV file specifying the jurisdictions to process.
        The CSV must contain at least two columns: "County" and "State",
        which specify the county and state names, respectively. If you
        would like to process a subdivision with a county, you must also
        include "Subdivision" and "Jurisdiction Type" columns. The
        "Subdivision" should be the name of the subdivision, and the
        "Jurisdiction Type" should be a string identifying the type of
        subdivision (e.g., "City", "Township", etc.)
    model : str or list of dict, optional
        LLM model(s) to use for scraping and parsing ordinance
        documents. If a string is provided, it is assumed to be the name
        of the default model (e.g., "gpt-4o"), and environment variables
        are used for authentication.

        If a list is provided, it should contain dictionaries of
        arguments that can initialize instances of
        :class:`~compass.llm.config.OpenAIConfig`. Each dictionary can
        specify the model name, client type, and initialization
        arguments.

        Each dictionary must also include a ``tasks`` key, which maps to
        a string or list of strings indicating the tasks that instance
        should handle. Exactly one of the instances **must** include
        "default" as a task, which will be used when no specific task is
        matched. For example::

            "model": [
                {
                    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
                    "llm_call_kwargs": {
                        "temperature": 0,
                        "timeout": 300,
                    },
                    "client_kwargs": {
                        "api_key": "<your_api_key>",
                        "api_version": "<your_api_version>",
                        "azure_endpoint": "<your_azure_endpoint>",
                    },
                    "tasks": ["default", "date_extraction"],
                },
                {
                    "model": "gpt-4o",
                    "client_type": "openai",
                    "tasks": ["ordinance_text_extraction"],
                }
            ]

        .. IMPORTANT::
            You will need to ensure that the model name used here
            matches your deployment if you are using Azure OpenAI. For
            example, if you deployed the GPT-4o-mini model under the
            name ``"gpt-4o-mini-2025-04-11"``, you would want to set
            ``"model": "gpt-4o-mini-2025-04-11"``.

        By default, ``"gpt-4o-mini"``.
    num_urls_to_check_per_jurisdiction : int, optional
        Number of unique Google search result URLs to check for each
        jurisdiction when attempting to locate ordinance documents.
        By default, ``5``.
    max_num_concurrent_browsers : int, optional
        Maximum number of browser instances to launch concurrently for
        retrieving information from the web. Increasing this value too
        much may lead to timeouts or performance issues on machines with
        limited resources. By default, ``10``.
    max_num_concurrent_website_searches : int, optional
        Maximum number of website searches allowed to run
        simultaneously. Increasing this value can speed up searches, but
        may lead to timeouts or performance issues on machines with
        limited resources. By default, ``10``.
    max_num_concurrent_jurisdictions : int, default=25
        Maximum number of jurisdictions to process concurrently.
        Limiting this can help manage memory usage when dealing with a
        large number of documents. By default ``25``.
    url_ignore_substrings : list of str, optional
        A list of substrings that, if found in any URL, will cause the
        URL to be excluded from consideration. This can be used to
        specify particular websites or entire domains to ignore. For
        example::

            url_ignore_substrings = [
                "wikipedia",
                "nlr.gov",
                "www.co.delaware.in.us/documents/1649699794_0382.pdf",
            ]

        The above configuration would ignore all `wikipedia` articles,
        all websites on the NLR domain, and the specific file located
        at `www.co.delaware.in.us/documents/1649699794_0382.pdf`.
        By default, ``None``.
    known_local_docs : dict or path-like, optional
        A dictionary where keys are the jurisdiction codes (as strings)
        and values are lists of dictionaries containing information
        about each document. The latter dictionaries should contain at
        least the key ``"source_fp"`` pointing to the **full** path of
        the local document file. All other keys will be added as
        attributes to the loaded document instance. You can include the
        key ``"check_if_legal_doc"`` to manually enable/disable the
        legal document check for known documents. Similarly, you can
        provide the ``"date"`` key, which is a list of
        ``[year, month, day]``, some or all of which can be null, to
        skip the date extraction step of the processing pipeline. If
        this input is provided, local documents will be checked first.
        See the top-level documentation of this function for the full
        processing of the pipeline. This input can also be a path to a
        JSON file containing the dictionary of code-to-document-info
        mappings. By default, ``None``.
    known_doc_urls : dict or path-like, optional
        A dictionary where keys are the jurisdiction codes (as strings)
        and values are lists of dictionaries containing information
        about each document. The latter dictionaries should contain at
        least the key ``"source"`` representing the known URL to check
        for that document. All other keys will be added as attributes
        to the loaded document instance. You can include the key
        ``"check_if_legal_doc"`` to manually enable/disable the legal
        document check for documents at known URLs. Similarly, you can
        provide the ``"date"`` key, which is a list of
        ``[year, month, day]``, some or all of which can be null, to
        skip the date extraction step of the processing pipeline. If
        this input is provided, the known URLs will be checked before
        applying the search engine search. See the top-level
        documentation of this function for the full processing order of
        the pipeline. This input can also be a path to a JSON file
        containing the dictionary of code-to-document-info mappings.

        .. Note:: The same input can be used for both `known_local_docs`
                  and `known_doc_urls` as long as both ``"source_fp"``
                  and ``"source"`` keys are provided in each document
                  info dictionary.

        By default, ``None``.
    file_loader_kwargs : dict, optional
        Dictionary of keyword arguments pairs to initialize
        :class:`elm.web.file_loader.AsyncWebFileLoader`. If found, the
        "pw_launch_kwargs" key in these will also be used to initialize
        the :class:`elm.web.search.google.PlaywrightGoogleLinkSearch`
        used for the google URL search. By default, ``None``.
    search_engines : list, optional
        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains
        information about a search engine class that should be used for
        the document retrieval process. Each dictionary should contain
        at least the key ``"se_name"``, which should correspond to one
        of the search engine class names from
        :obj:`elm.web.search.run.SEARCH_ENGINE_OPTIONS`. The rest of the
        keys in the dictionary should contain keyword-value pairs to be
        used as parameters to initialize the search engine class (things
        like API keys and configuration options; see the ELM
        documentation for details on search engine class parameters).
        The list should be ordered by search engine preference - the
        first search engine parameters will be used to submit the
        queries initially, then any subsequent search engine listings
        will be used as fallback (in order that they appear). Do not
        repeat search engines - only the last config dictionary will be
        used to initialize the search engine if you do. If ``None``,
        then all default configurations for the search engines
        (along with the fallback order) are used. By default, ``None``.
    pytesseract_exe_fp : path-like, optional
        Path to the `pytesseract` executable. If specified, OCR will be
        used to extract text from scanned PDFs using Google's Tesseract.
        By default ``None``.
    td_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to
        :class:`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`. The temporary directory is
        used to store documents which have not yet been confirmed to
        contain relevant information. By default, ``None``.
    tpe_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to
        :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, used for
        I/O-bound tasks such as logging. By default, ``None``.
    ppe_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to
        :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`, used for
        CPU-bound tasks such as PDF loading and parsing.
        By default, ``None``.
    log_dir : path-like, optional
        Path to the directory for storing log files. If not provided, a
        ``logs`` subdirectory will be created inside `out_dir`.
        By default, ``None``.
    clean_dir : path-like, optional
        Path to the directory for storing cleaned ordinance text output.
        If not provided, a ``cleaned_text`` subdirectory will be created
        inside `out_dir`. By default, ``None``.
    ordinance_file_dir : path-like, optional
        Path to the directory where downloaded ordinance files (PDFs or
        HTML) for each jurisdiction are stored. If not provided, a
        ``ordinance_files`` subdirectory will be created inside
        `out_dir`. By default, ``None``.
    jurisdiction_dbs_dir : path-like, optional
        Path to the directory where parsed ordinance database files are
        stored for each jurisdiction. If not provided, a
        ``jurisdiction_dbs`` subdirectory will be created inside
        `out_dir`. By default, ``None``.
    perform_se_search : bool, default=True
        Option to perform a search engine-based search for ordinance
        documents. This is the standard way to collect ordinance
        documents, and it is recommended to leave this set to ``True``
        unless you are re-processing local documents. If ``True``, the
        search engine approach is used to locate ordinance documents
        before falling back to a website crawl-based search (if that has
        been selected). By default, ``True``.
    perform_website_search : bool, default=True
        Option to fallback to a jurisdiction website crawl-based search
        for ordinance documents if the search engine approach fails to
        recover any relevant documents. By default, ``True``.
    llm_costs : dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping model names to their token costs, used to
        track the estimated total cost of LLM usage during the run. The
        structure should be::

            {"model_name": {"prompt": float, "response": float}}

        Costs are specified in dollars per million tokens. For example::

            "llm_costs": {"my_gpt": {"prompt": 1.5, "response": 3.7}}

        registers a model named `"my_gpt"` with a cost of $1.5 per
        million input (prompt) tokens and $3.7 per million output
        (response) tokens for the current processing run.

        .. NOTE::

            The displayed total cost does not track cached tokens, so
            treat it like an estimate. Your final API costs may vary.

        If set to ``None``, no custom model costs are recorded, and
        cost tracking may be unavailable in the progress bar.
        By default, ``None``.
    log_level : str, optional
        Logging level for ordinance scraping and parsing (e.g., "TRACE",
        "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", or "ERROR"). By default, ``"INFO"``.
    keep_async_logs : bool, default=False
        Option to store the full asynchronous log record to a file. This
        is only useful if you intend to monitor overall processing
        progress from a file instead of from the terminal. If ``True``,
        all of the unordered records are written to a "all.log" file in
        the `log_dir` directory. By default, ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Message summarizing run results, including total processing
        time, total cost, output directory, and number of documents
        found. The message is formatted for easy reading in the terminal
        and may include color-coded cost information if the terminal
        supports it.
